## Macherkevich Mikhail - CV

On the scale of hardcore developer <-> über-manager I am exactly in the middle, combining best from the two worlds. 

After 2 years of trying to conquer the “music + travel” market with GigsGuide startup I am starting to look at the market for new opportunities.
My main aptitude lies in a narrow gap between technical stuff and product management.

Having vast technical background (mostly in web-related software) and always ongoing product development experience I am a great fit for any position that requires a cross between those.

### On the question of development

I can and love to code (and I even contribute to opensource, from time to time). 
Nevertheless I am always careful when bringing new software to the project, thinking business first, fun - later.
Usually I focus on fast results preferring to test something and then letting those amazing devs do their job properly, yet most of the time my code is more then enough for any MVP level project and usually can be used even further. 
Things I value in the code are Development Speed and Readability. Only most significant optimizations are usually on my plate and most of the times - at later stages. Together with managing in-house our outsource team I can create a web application all by myself. That is something I pride.

### On the question of product management

Never being a pure product analytic / manager I was always juggling between tasks of various levels, starting from business perspective and back to the very core of product metrics. I am far more happy having a proper product model set up, then guessing where we will be in a month based on a hunch and some cool ideas. I really like to have my numbers crunched. Of course, there is so much stuff that can be influencing any results, but at the same time I see so many product problems based on pure neglect of doing a rather simple homework. 
I am the guy who sets things right. As much as I can, of course. 

### On the question of persona

I am a mildly cheerful guy, divorced, with a child. I can't remember a real personal conflict for years, which can say a lot about me - both good and bad. I like games, music and having a walk in good weather. My soft-skill knack, I think, is teaching. I like to teach people when they are interested. I am pretty much self-sufficient, but I really like to work in a team. 


### A bit about my 'path of the hero'

Having a technical education I started working as a developer back in 2007-2008 (after a brief career in creating 3d-tours), then after half a year of travelling I have joined major semi-government organisation where I have worked for five years for three reasons 
- team (which was epic) 
- salary (which was really nice)
- and cool projects we used to do. 
There I grew up from a guy who does as he is told to a guy who is tasked with deciding what to do in everything considering the corporate presence on the internet.

Next stage (kinda obvious) was my own startup. I launched it with a friend, made tons of errors, got tons of experience and closed it when the local economic crisis drastically shrank the market. My job was mostly related to handling products and trying to find us clients. I have failed miserably with later, but for former, at the very least, we had a nice pivot that let us stay afloat for another 6 month. 

For the next year I was an CEO of my own company of 1.5 people helping various clients (from small e-commerce to nation-wide government funds) to do their jobs better. I helped them as a consultant and as lead of the "outsource development team'' which I found and hired for them. As an additional achievement, I have launched a pretty successful product based on online acquiring from the biggest local bank - starting from finding a niche and going as far as being contacted by other banks in half a year, about helping them to provide online acquiring for various small companies. 

In 2017 I joined forces with GigsGuide founder, starting with MVP and going through a major pivot (from B2B to temporary B2C) to a website that is mentioned on BBC, The Guardian and others. My main area of responsibility was technical stuff - both supervising the internal and external development teams and coding the more hardcore parts of the backend. Still, being a founder I went through two accelerators and dealt on a daily basis with all sides of the product, starting from high-level pitch creation to trying to balance retention rates. 

### What I am looking for

A great team. Because the team is always super-important. 
A cool product to work with. I do not restrict myself from any markets, expect, probably, alcohol and tobacco. 
A position with fairly high level of responsibilities and decision making. 
A full time position (we can discuss part time or project based job)
Anything between a full-remote and an office job (note, that that will require relocation). 

### Now - some buzzwords
